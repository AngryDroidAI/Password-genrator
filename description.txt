Password Generator Project
Objective: Create a web-based password generator that provides strong, randomly generated passwords with various customization options, a user-friendly interface, and additional features for enhanced user experience.

Features:

Customizable Password Length:

Users can specify the desired length of the password using an input field, ranging from 8 to 100 characters.

Character Set Selection:

Users can choose the character set for the password:

All characters (letters, digits, symbols)

Letters and digits only

Letters only

Digits only

Dark Mode Toggle:

A button that allows users to switch between dark mode (default) and light mode for better visibility and comfort.

Password Strength Indicator:

Provides feedback on the strength of the generated password (Weak, Medium, Strong) based on criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.

Copy to Clipboard:

A button that allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click, followed by a confirmation alert.

Password History:

Displays a history of passwords generated during the session, allowing users to refer back to previously generated passwords.

Animations and Transitions:

Smooth transition effects for background and text color changes to enhance the user experience.

Technical Details:

HTML Structure:

The HTML structure includes input fields for password length and character set selection, buttons for generating the password, copying it to the clipboard, toggling dark mode, and a text area to display the generated password. There's also a section for displaying password strength and history.

CSS Styling:

The CSS provides a cyber-themed look with a dark background, neon-green text, and a monospaced font. It includes styles for buttons, text areas, and transitions for dark mode toggling.

JavaScript Functions:

generatePassword(): Generates a random password based on user-selected options and updates the text area.

copyPassword(): Copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows an alert.

checkStrength(): Evaluates the password strength and updates the indicator.

addToHistory(): Adds the generated password to the history section.

toggleDarkMode(): Toggles between dark mode and light mode by changing the background and text colors.

This enhanced password generator project offers a robust, user-friendly tool for creating secure passwords. By incorporating customization options, a dark mode, a copy-to-clipboard feature, and password history, it provides an engaging and practical experience for users.
