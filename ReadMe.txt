Simple File Host and Share Link Generator
Objective: To create a web-based application that allows users to upload files and generate shareable links for viewing and downloading the uploaded files. This is a purely client-side solution designed for small-scale use, meaning files are hosted locally within the user's browser session.

Features:

File Upload:

Users can select a file from their local device to upload.

The application supports various file types and sizes within the browser's capabilities.

Shareable Link Generation:

Upon uploading, a unique URL is generated for each file.

The generated link allows users to either view or download the file.

File List Display:

A list of uploaded files is displayed on the page.

Each file in the list includes options to view or download.

Futuristic Cyber-Themed Design:

The interface has a modern, cyber-themed look with neon green and dark colors.

The design includes animated effects for buttons and inputs to enhance user experience.

Detailed Code Description
HTML Structure: The HTML structure includes a form for file uploads, a section for displaying the shareable link of the uploaded file, and a list of all uploaded files. Explanation of Key Components:
File Input and Upload Button:

Users can select a file using the file input.

The "Upload File" button triggers the generateLink() function to handle the file upload.

Shareable Link Section:

Displays the generated URL of the uploaded file.

Provides the user with a link to share.

Uploaded Files List:

Lists all uploaded files with options to view or download.

Each list item includes the file name, a view link, and a download link.

JavaScript Functions:

generateLink(): Handles the file upload, generates a URL using URL.createObjectURL(), updates the shareable link display, and adds the file to the list of uploaded files.

addFileToList(fileName, fileLink): Adds an uploaded file to the list with options to view and download.

Advantages and Limitations:
Advantages:

Quick and simple to set up and use.

Purely client-side, no need for a server.

Provides instant shareable links.

Limitations:

Files are only accessible while the browser session is active.

No server-side storage or advanced file management.

Not suitable for large-scale or long-term file hosting.

This project provides a straightforward and effective way to share files temporarily within a browser
